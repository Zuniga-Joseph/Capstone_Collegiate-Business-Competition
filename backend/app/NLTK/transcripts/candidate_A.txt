[00:00] Okay team, I think our goal is to maximize user retention. Does everyone agree?
[00:08] Thanks for sharing those numbers earlier — that really helped me see where users drop off.
[00:16] I might be wrong, but maybe we should simplify onboarding first.
[00:24] I understand what you’re saying, though — the marketing funnel matters too.
[00:32] How about we test both ideas and compare?
[00:40] We missed that detail last round, but we adapted quickly — I think we’ll handle this too.
[00:48] I can apply that feedback right now; maybe I’ll rephrase the question.
[00:56] Yeah, exactly — could you clarify what the success metric would be?
[01:04] Good point; we should align on a single goal.
[01:12] I appreciate the reminder — I’ll document the process this time.
[01:20] Let’s lock in option B; it gives us a faster learning loop.
[01:28] Even if it’s not perfect, we’ll iterate and improve next round.
[01:36] I like how everyone’s contributing — this has been really collaborative.
[01:44] Thank you all for the feedback; I’ll reflect it in our next sprint.
